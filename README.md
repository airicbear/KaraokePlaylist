## Build

You'll need a copy of Java JDK (version 1.8 or 11).
[Azul Builds](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk)
are production-ready builds of OpenJDK which you may download
and install on your computer for free.

You also may need to
[install PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and
create a database called `dev`.
If you wish to use a different database (e.g., H2) you would
need to adjust the SQL  queries and the application configuration
accordingly.
